Function can be run directly; e.g. 'python dWaySolver.py' or 'python 2WaySolverTest.py' from the command line
The output of 'dWaySolver' and '2WaySolver' files are the average times taken over 1,000 trials of each of the three heuristics I implemented
The outpue of the '~Test.py' functions run the solver just once for each heuristic, and print out the solution
